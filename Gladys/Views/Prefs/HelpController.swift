You can change this setting from the options panel.\n\nTo delete a label from all items that contain it, you can swipe to delete it from the labels popup on the top-right.\n\nYou can drag text items, or data components to the label area of an item's info view to create a new label with that text."
		case 3: return "Data components are the entries inside an item's info view.\n\nSwipe data components to the left to delete them.\n\nSwipe data components to the right to copy only that component to the clipboard instead of the whole item.\n\nDrag data components out of an item's info view in order to create a stand-alone item with just that component.\n\nAlternatively, if you activate 'Allow Merging' in options, you can drag a data component into other items to merge it with their existing data components, such as adding a URL to an image for example."

Please bear in mind that the type of data which is sent using this method may be less detailed than the data that is provided by drag-and-drop.\n\nThe Apple Watch app allows for quick browsing and copying of recent items. Force-press an item to bring up more options, such as copying it to the clipboard, or opening the item's info view on your phone.\n\nThe Today Widget allows fast access to recently added items from the home screen. You can tap on an item to quickly copy it to the clipboard.\n\nThe iMessage app allows you to quickly search and add an item from Gladys to a message."
		case 5: return "Gladys supports the x-callback-url scheme for interoperability with other apps.\n\nCurrently it supports one action: 'paste-clipboard', and you can invoke it like this:\n\ngladys://x-callback-url/paste-clipboard\n?title=Override%20The%20Title\n&labels=Pasted%20Item,New%20Items\n&note=Some%20Notes\n\nAll the parameters are optional, but be sure to properly url-encode special characters, such as spaces. The callbacks support x-success and x-error parameters."
		case 6: return "Gladys does not monitor or report anything at all. You can find a detailed description of the privacy policy on the Gladys web site from the link in the About panel."
		case 7: return "There is currently no macOS version of Gladys.\n\nLike so many users who have contacted me and politely expressed their interest in such a version, I too really want to create one as soon as limited time and resources allow.\n\nMeanwhile, please note that Gladys does work seamlessly with Handoff, meaning that short/medium text items can be pasted into Gladys after being copied on a Mac, and vice-versa."
